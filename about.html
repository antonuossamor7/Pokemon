        <p class="text">The Pokémon Go app hit the streets a couple years ago and people are STILL playing! For our project we decided to analyze location data and various attributes for 16 different Pokémon.go for San Francisco because it is one of the few city for which we have good database in www.kaggle.com.
          After working on two databases we were able to make three visualization based on two reliable databases. We mainly used SQL and D3.js to work on making ID cards for the 16 more popular Pokemon in the San Francisco area. We also made a comparative graph as well as a localization map of where the Pokemon were found. For this last visualiztion, we also used MapBox.
